As part of my internship at Inkblot Media Group, I was tasked with creating a new design for the website of a potential client. The website was a storefront for selling woodworking products. 

To create the wireframe mockups, I used the Mockup app on my 7th Gen iPad with my Apple Pencil. I then uploaded the images of the wireframes to Canva, which I then used to create the report pages.

  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_redesign/client_site_blur_1.png">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_redesign/client_site_blur_1.png" alt="page 1 of report" width="400" style="border-radius:10px;"/>
  </a>
</p>

In my section of the report, I listed the issues with the current website design. These issues included the design being boring, having no call to action for the user, no structure in some pages, and information being unclear.

Note that the name of the client and their logos are blurred in the images to respect their privacy.

  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_redesign/client_site_blur_2.png">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_redesign/client_site_blur_2.png" alt="page 2 of report" width="400" style="border-radius:10px;"/>
  </a>
</p>

I then display the wireframes for the redesign. To create the initial layout, I decided to look up some best practices for ecommerce website layouts like how products should be displayed and how information should be organized. To do this, I consulted various resources such as [UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-for-e-commerce-principles-and-strategies-9df7d81e59d8) and [nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ecommerce-product-pages/). 

Since the site also had a page dedicated for video guides, I also did some research on common layouts for displaying multiple YouTube links on a page.

One extremely critical area where I was admittedly lacking is user research. It was always my intention to conduct user research to determine what customers would want to have on a website like this. However, I was only able to do up to basic wireframe designs because the client did not push through with taking us up.

  </a>
</p>

Nevertheless, I did what I could to obey [Jakob's Law of UX](https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/) and make the rough draft of the design resemble commonly used site layouts. Additionally, learned a lot about what should go into a good proposal for a client. We were not just doing a redesign of the site but also a restructuring of their marketing plan. Knowing this, we needed the proposal to have details on what we wanted to change about their marketing strategy.

I also learned that there are a lot of resources that you can find online about tried and tested layouts that you can build off of after conducting user research and user tests. Of course, it is still best to do your own research and testing to come up with the best design for your users.
