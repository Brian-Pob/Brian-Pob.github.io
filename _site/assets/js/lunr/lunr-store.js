        "excerpt":"               This site that you are currently reading this article on was built by me! Since I wanted to market myself as a web developer and a UX Designer, I decided to build my own website instead of using something like uxfolio. I wanted something that I could host for free that wouldn’t have too many parts too it so I could easily maintain it and add content to it.   Why I Chose Jekyll   With so many ways to build a website available for me to learn, I had to choose one that would fit my needs. I have experience using Node.Js with Express and MongoDB for building a website in a web development course that I took in 2018, but there were a few issues with that.   First, it felt like building it with Node  would be a bit too much for a simple portfolio site with static content. I know that I don’t have to build this website with things like account creation or cookies. I also knew that GitHub pages doesn’t support JavaScript frameworks like Node since it really is meant for static content.   While it would definitely have been good practice, I decided to go with something simpler.   Enter Jekyll.      Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost. Jekyll can be used in combination with front-end frameworks such as BootStrap, Semantic UI and many others.    That is Wikipedia’s description of Jekyll. In short, GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites for free and Jekyll can be used to convert Markdown into HTML for static websites. While Jekyll may not be all that useful for webapps, its lightweight and easy-to-use nature make it perfect for small static sites like personal blogs.   TODO: Add image here   Another thing that makes Jekyll great is how easy it is to apply a theme for your site and make it look and feel good from the get go. For example, this site uses the free and open-source Minimal Mistakes theme made by Michael Rose.   You can easily find a free theme that suits your needs and your tastes. Plus, there are also paid themes that you can use for your site. Giving you even more options while also being able to support developers.   TODO: Plan outline.   Hi. If you are reading this, then thank you! I am currently in the process of writing this article so it is incomplete. In case you are curious, below are a few lines detailing a rough idea I have for what I want to put in this article.  ---  Talk about how lightweight it is so I can make new articles fairly easily.  I can compile and run a jekyll site with underpowered hardware.  I can edit it directly on GitHub using GitHub.dev.  I can even edit the code remotely using my 2nd PC at home.  Then I can use SSH tunneling with through an app to access that PC's localhost so I can preview the site on Safari for iPad. It really is super cool. It has a lot of features. Minimal Mistakes is awesome.  There was a learning curve but once I sat down and devoted time to learning it I was able to build this site and add content.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Electronic Storefront Redesign",
        "excerpt":"              As part of my internship at Inkblot Media Group, I was tasked with creating a new design for the website of a potential client. The website was a storefront for selling woodworking products.   To create the wireframe mockups, I used the Mockup app on my 7th Gen iPad with my Apple Pencil. I then uploaded the images of the wireframes to Canva, which I then used to create the report pages.                                                                                                                                Photos of the old design of the site                      In my section of the report, I listed the issues with the current website design. These issues included the design being boring, having no call to action for the user, no structure in some pages, and information being unclear.   Note that the name of the client and their logos are blurred in the images to respect their privacy.                  I then display the wireframes for the redesign. To create the initial layout, I decided to look up some best practices for ecommerce website layouts like how products should be displayed and how information should be organized. To do this, I consulted various resources such as UX Planet and nngroup.com.   Since the site also had a page dedicated for video guides, I also did some research on common layouts for displaying multiple YouTube links on a page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wireframes for the redesigned site       One extremely critical area where I was admittedly lacking is user research. It was always my intention to conduct user research to determine what customers would want to have on a website like this. However, I was only able to do up to basic wireframe designs because the client did not push through with taking us up.                  Nevertheless, I did what I could to obey Jakob’s Law of UX and make the rough draft of the design resemble commonly used site layouts. Additionally, learned a lot about what should go into a good proposal for a client. We were not just doing a redesign of the site but also a restructuring of their marketing plan. Knowing this, we needed the proposal to have details on what we wanted to change about their marketing strategy.   I also learned that there are a lot of resources that you can find online about tried and tested layouts that you can build off of after conducting user research and user tests. Of course, it is still best to do your own research and testing to come up with the best design for your users.
